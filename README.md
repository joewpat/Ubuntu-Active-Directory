# Ubuntu-Active-Directory
Ubuntu AD Stuff

This script joins the designated AD Domain using the included configuration files. Excuse my commenting, this script was not intended to be shared but I felt it's a good example nonetheless.

This is tested and verified on Ubuntu 18.04. The steps for 16.04 were only slightly different.

Most of the config files will need to be modified for your domain. 
The placeholder will be DOMAIN.TLD for fields that need to be modified, generally.
